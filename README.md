This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripts: improper handling of filenames containing spaces. The `bug.sh` script showcases the error, while `bugSolution.sh` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from how the shell expands wildcard characters when spaces are present in filenames.  The solution involves using appropriate quoting or other techniques to correctly handle these situations.
